Q.1 In the last 4 seconds of its survival, the velocity (v) profile of chandrayaan-2 showed
fluctuation as it approaches towards the moon surface, given by the following function of
time (t):

v = 5 cos(10t) + t<sup>3<\sup> - 2t<sup>2<\sup> -6t + 10

a) Report the Condition Number (C.N) of the function at t=2.2 s.
