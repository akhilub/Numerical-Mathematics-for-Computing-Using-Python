Q1: The general form of a three-dimensional stress field is given by a 2nd order stress tensor as

    σ = [σxx σxy σxz ]
        [σyx σyy σyz ]                            (1)
        [σzx σzy σzz ]

where the diagonal terms represent tensile or compressive stresses and the off-diagonal terms represent
shear stresses. A stress field is given by
      
      σ = [10 14 25]
          [14 7 15 ] × 10 <sup>6</sup>            (2)  \int_{i=1}^n
          [25 15 16] 
.


Principal stresses (σ1, σ2, σ3 ) are known to be the three eigen values of stress tensor σ. For any given
stress tensor σ, it is essential to construct the following matrix
