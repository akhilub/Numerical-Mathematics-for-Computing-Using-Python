Q.1 In python, define the vector vec1 with size (1x3) and matrices mat1 with size (3x3) as:

       vec1 = [-1 4 -9]
       
       mat1 = [1 3 5 ]
              [7 -9 2]
              [4  6 8]

and perform following operations.

a) Compute  vec2 = pi/4 * vec1

b) Compute  vec3 = cos(vec2)

c) Compute  vec4 = vec1 + 2*vec3

d) Compute  norm(vec4)

e) Compute the product of mat1 and vec4 and set vec5 equal to the result.

f) Compute the transpose of mat1

g) Compute the determinant of mat1

h) Compute the trace of mat1.



Q.2: Write a program to extract first and third elements of both the first and third rows from a given
(4x4) array made with random values. Also find the minimum and maximum elements in this 4x4 array.
