Q.1 In python, define the vector vec1 with size (1x3) and matrices mat1 with size (3x3) as:

       vec1 = [-1 4 -9]
       
       mat1 = [1 3 5 ]
              [7 -9 2]
              [4  6 8]

and perform following operations.

a) Compute  vec2 = pi/4 * vec1

b) Compute  vec3 = cos(vec2)

c) Compute  vec4 = vec1 + 2*vec3

d) Compute  norm(vec4)

e) Compute the product of mat1 and vec4 and set vec5 equal to the result.

f) Compute the transpose of mat1

g) Compute the determinant of mat1

h) Compute the trace of mat1.



Q.2: Write a program to extract first and third elements of both the first and third rows from a given
(4x4) array made with random values. Also find the minimum and maximum elements in this 4x4 array.


Q.3. Create a row vector called meshPoints containing exactly 500 values with values evenly spaced
between -1 and 1.
a) Print the value of the 53th element of meshPoints?
b) Produce a plot of sin(x) between -2*pi and 2*pi having 500 data point in between by using
meshPoints vector.
This plot should have clearly labelled x- & y- axis showing the variable name along x-axis and
function along y-axis.


Q.4. Evaluate e <sup>-5</sup> using two approaches

a) e <sup>-5</sup> = 1 − x + x <sup>2</sup>/2! - x <sup>2</sup>/3!+...

b) e <sup>-5</sup> = 1/e <sup>x</sup> = 1 /( 1 − x + x <sup>2</sup>/2! - x <sup>2</sup>/3!+...)

and compare with the true value of e<sup>-5</sup> = 6.737947 × 10−3 for each case. 

Use 20 terms to evaluate each series and compute true (ε<sub>t</sub> %) and approximate relative
(ε<sub>a</sub> %) errors as terms are added one-by-one. Assume 7 significant figures (n) in the
approximation to calculate ε<sub>s</sub> = (0.5 × 10<sup>2-n</sup>)%.

I. The results are to be presented in a tabular form for case (a) and case (b) showing
“Term no” in first column, “Term value” in second column, “True relative error
(%)” in third column and “Approximate relative error (%)” in fourth column.


II. Plot the variation of εt % for case (a) and case (b) Versus “Term no” in a single
plot. Use blue color line to represent case (a) results and red color line to
represent case (b) results. Mark the legends for red line as “Case (a)” and for blue
line as “Case (b)”. The xlabel for the plot should be “Term no” and ylabel for this
plot should be “True relative error (%)”.


III. Plot the variation of ε<sub>a</sub> % for case (a) and case (b) Versus “Term no” in a single
plot. Use blue color line to represent case (a) results and red color line to represent case (b) results. 
Mark the legends for red line as “Case (a)” and for blue line as “Case (b)”. The xlabel for the plot should be “Term no” and ylabel for this
plot should be “Approximate relative error (%)”.

IV. Find how many terms are required for ε<sub>a</sub> < ε<sub>s</sub>for both cases.
